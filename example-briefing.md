**Can You Inception Yourself Into Solving Problems?**

So this dropped Thursday and I genuinely can't stop thinking about it.

Ken Paller's lab at Northwestern published a study on what they're calling "dream engineering" — using targeted memory reactivation (TMR) to nudge the content of dreams during REM sleep, then measuring whether those nudged dreams actually help people solve problems they couldn't crack while awake. The method: participants attempted a set of brain-teaser puzzles, each paired with a unique soundtrack. Then they slept in the lab. During REM, the researchers replayed soundtracks from half the unsolved puzzles — essentially whispering "hey, think about this one" to a sleeping brain.

The results are striking. 75% of participants dreamed about the cued puzzles. And puzzles that got incorporated into dreams were solved at more than double the rate of uncued ones — 42% versus 17%.

Now, the careful caveat: this doesn't conclusively prove that *dreaming* caused the solving. It's possible that curiosity or engagement with a particular puzzle independently increases both dreaming and solving. The researchers are honest about this. But even as a proof of concept for controllable dream content, it's remarkable — because the hard part has always been that you can't systematically *tell* someone what to dream about. Until, apparently, you can.

The dream doesn't solve the puzzle by running the same algorithm the waking mind ran. It remixes — fragments of the puzzle show up in new contexts, next to unrelated imagery, mashed together in ways the executive mind wouldn't permit. That's not noise. That's the brain exploring a different region of the solution space by relaxing the constraints on what can co-occur.

The paper is in *Current Biology* if you want the primary source.

**In Brief**

🔬 **AI makes you more creative but everyone less original.** Doshi & Hauser in *Science Advances*: when individuals use generative AI for creative tasks, their individual output improves — but the collective diversity of what everyone produces drops.

📜 **On this day in 1493**, Columbus wrote his famous open letter aboard the *Niña* describing what he'd found in the New World — one of the first widely distributed texts about the Americas, essentially going viral through hand-copying across Europe.

🎵 **SomaFM pick: Deep Space One** — deep ambient electronic, good for the kind of diffuse-attention state where you let problems solve themselves.

💬 **Word: гулять (gulyat')** — Russian, literally "to walk/stroll," but culturally it carries *going out, being out in the world, enjoying yourself outside.* English has no single verb for this.

🛠️ **This exists:** tilde.town — an intentional computing community where people build weird little HTML pages, write poetry in plaintext, and leave notes for each other. The anti-algorithm internet.
